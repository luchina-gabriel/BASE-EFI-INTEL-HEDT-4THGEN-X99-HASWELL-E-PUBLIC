# Compatible SMBIOS

SMBIOS|Description
:----|:----
iMacPro1,1|Works for Haswell-E Processors
MacPro7,1|Works for Haswell-E Processors

# Catalina and older versions of macOS

- Please configure `MinDate` and `MinVersion` in UEFI > APFS to `-1`;
- Please configure `SecureBootModel` in Misc > Security to `j137`;

\* *Without above settings, macOS will not be able to boot.*

# macOS Sonoma 14.4 or above versions (including macOS Sequoia (v15))
- Please configure `SecureBootModel` to `Disabled`;
- After the installation is completed, you can return the value to 'Default';
- If the above adjustment is not performed, the installation will be in a looping.

# Special notes

- USB port mapping is **REQUIRED**.
- **`XhciPortLimit`** - Please `**ENABLE**` to map the USB ports
	- You can use USBMap.command Utility - [USBMap](https://github.com/corpnewt/USBMap).
- **`AppleCpuPmCfgLock`** - Please `**ENABLE**` if you cannot disable`CFG-Lock` in BIOS AND running 10.10 or older macOS.
- **`AppleXcpmCfgLock`** - Please `**ENABLE**` if you cannot disable`CFG-Lock` in BIOS.

### GPU-Specific `boot-args`
Parameter|Description
:----|:----
agdpmod=pikera|Used for disabling board ID checks on Navi GPUs(RX 5000 series & RX 6000 series), without this you'll get a black screen.<br>**Don't use if you don't have Navi** (ie. Polaris and Vega cards shouldn't use this).
nvda_drv_vrl=1|Used for enabling Nvidia's Web Drivers on Maxwell and Pascal cards in Sierra and High Sierra.

### General Purpose `boot-args`
Parameter|Description
:----|:----
npci=0x2000|This disables some PCI debugging related to `kIOPCIConfiguratorPFM64`, alternative is `npci=0x3000` which disables debugging related to `gIOPCITunnelledKey` in addition.<br>Required for when getting stuck on `PCI Start Configuration` as there are IRQ conflicts relating to your PCI lanes. **Not needed if Above4GDecoding is enabled.**
npci=0x3000|Alternative for `npci=0x2000`.

# BIOS Settings

### Disable
- Fast Boot
- Secure Boot
- Serial/COM Port
- Parallel Port
- VT-d (can be enabled if you set `DisableIoMapper` to YES)
- Compatibility Support Module (CSM).
- Thunderbolt(For initial install, as Thunderbolt can cause issues if not setup correctly)
- Intel SGX
- Intel Platform Trust
- CFG Lock (MSR 0xE2 write protection)
	- This must be off, if you can't find the option then **`ENABLE`** `AppleXcpmCfgLock`. 
	- Your hack will not boot with CFG-Lock enabled.
	- For 10.10 and older, you'll need to **`ENABLE`** `AppleCpuPmCfgLock` as well.

### Enable
- VT-x
- Above 4G decoding. 
	- This must be on, if you can't find the option then add `npci=0x2000` to `boot-args`. 
	- Do not have both this option and `npci` on `boot-args` enabled at the same time.
- Hyper-Threading
- Execute Disable Bit
- EHCI/XHCI Hand-off
- OS type: Windows 8.1/10 UEFI Mode
- SATA Mode: AHCI
